Project Title: "MVS COMP (FPS)"

Description: My game is a much harder version of the original. There are less heal parts and 3x as much enemys. The game also includes many secrets from pyramids to holes in the floor. I also added trees and other items for decor and overall just a better version of the game.

Setup Instructions: How to open and run your game. None

Reflection: My game creation overall went great. I got all the parts to work eventually but it was very difficult. The main problem was i did not really know how to use the different controls. I was not used to any of editing tools and it took me a while to figure it out. Also some parts and items that i was placing would not go to the right place and i didnt find out how to move my camera until i was half way done the game. But other than all of that i was able to place all the items and get the game to run perfectly.
